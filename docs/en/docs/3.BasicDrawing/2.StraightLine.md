# Straight line

We can create a line by instantiating an McDbLine() object. Draw a line by setting the startPoint and endPoint of the McDbLine() instance object, or you can directly use the constructor of McDbLine() to directly set the start point and end point of the line, such as: new McDbLine(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) can also set a variety of properties such as line color trueColor, linear scale linetypeScale, etc.

In addition, it is possible to draw a line directly through the drawLine() method provided by the mxcad instance object.

Click [McDbLine()](../../api/classes/2d.McDbLine.md) 、[drawLine()](../../api/classes/2d.McObject.md#drawline) for detailed property and method descriptions.

```ts
import { MxCpp, McCmColor, McDbLine, McGePoint3d } from "mxcad"

const mxcad = MxCpp.getCurrentMxCAD()
const line = new McDbLine(0, 0, 0, -80, -80, 0)
line.trueColor = new McCmColor(255, 0, 0)
mxcad.drawEntity(line)

const line_1 = new McDbLine()
let pt1 = new McGePoint3d(100,100,0)
let pt2 = new McGePoint3d(0,0,0)
line_1.startPoint = pt1
line_1.endPoint = pt2
mxcad.drawEntity(line_1)

mxcad.drawLine(pt1.x, pt1.y, pt2.x, pt2.y)
```

```tsx
import {  McObject, McDbLine, McGePoint3d, McCmColor } from "mxcad"

export default () => {
    const mxcad = new McObject()
    mxcad.create({
      canvas: "#myCanvas",
      locateFile: (fileName: string)=> {
            // CDN loading must use resources in wasm/ 2D-ST, because github restrictions cannot use wasm/2d resources
            // Use wasm/2d to comply with the browser same-origin policy or use other means to circumvent the browser same-origin policy
            return self.location.origin + "/mxcad_docs/wasm/2d-st/" + fileName
      },
      // The directory location where the font is loaded
      fontspath: self.location.origin + "/mxcad_docs/fonts",

      onOpenFileComplete: ()=>{
            let line_1 = new McDbLine()
            let pt1 = new McGePoint3d(1000,200,0)
            let pt2 = new McGePoint3d(-1000,-200,0)
            line_1.startPoint = pt1
            line_1.endPoint = pt2
            line_1.trueColor = new McCmColor(0, 255, 0)
            mxcad.drawEntity(line_1)

            let line_2 = new McDbLine(1000,500,0,-1000,-500,0)
            line_2.trueColor = new McCmColor(255,0, 0)
            line_2.linetypeScale = 0.4
            mxcad.drawEntity(line_2)

            mxcad.drawLine(1000,800,-1000,-800)

            mxcad.zoomAll()
            mxcad.zoomScale(0.8)
      }
    })
    return (<div style="height: 500px; overflow: hidden;"><canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
    </div>)
}
