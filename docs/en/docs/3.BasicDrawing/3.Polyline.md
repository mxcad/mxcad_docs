# Polyline

We can create a multiline by instantiating an McDbPolyline() object.

A multi-segment line is a multi-segment connection line composed of arcs and lines. Users can draw multiple lines with any line type. After at least one multi-segment line has been drawn, the erase() method can be called to remove the previous line segment. After two or more multi-segment lines are drawn, the isClosed() method can be called to close the current multiple lines and draw a line segment that ends with the start of the first line segment. The addVertexAt() method can also be called to set the vertex position of the multi-segment line, the width of the line and the crown of the arc. Combined with [command mode](../4.InteractiveDrawing/1.CommandLine.md), you can add vertices, delete vertices, convert to arc, convert to line and other complete functions.

```ts
import { MxCpp, McGePoint3d, McDbPolyline } from "mxcad"
const mxcad = MxCpp.getCurrentMxCAD()
const polyline = new McDbPolyline()
polyline.isClosed = true
polyline.constantWidth = 10
polyline.addVertexAt(new McGePoint3d(800, 300, 0))
polyline.addVertexAt(new McGePoint3d(900, 300, 0))
polyline.addVertexAt(new McGePoint3d(900, 400, 0))
mxcad.drawEntity(polyline)
```
:::demo
```tsx
import {  McObject, McDbPolyline, McGePoint3d, McCmColor } from "mxcad"

export default () => {
    const mxcad = new McObject()
    mxcad.create({
      canvas: "#myCanvas",
      locateFile: (fileName: string)=> {
            // CDN loading must use resources in wasm/ 2D-ST, because github restrictions cannot use wasm/2d resources
            // Use wasm/2d to comply with the browser same-origin policy or use other means to circumvent the browser same-origin policy
            return self.location.origin + "/mxcad_docs/wasm/2d-st/" + fileName
      },
      // The directory location where the font is loaded
      fontspath: self.location.origin + "/mxcad_docs/fonts",
      // Load the converted drawing file
      fileUrl: self.location.origin + "/mxcad_docs/test.mxweb",
      onOpenFileComplete: ()=>{
            const polyline = new McDbPolyline()
            polyline.isClosed = true
            polyline.constantWidth = 5
            polyline.addVertexAt(new McGePoint3d(800, 300, 0))
            polyline.addVertexAt(new McGePoint3d(900, 300, 0))
            polyline.addVertexAt(new McGePoint3d(900, 400, 0))
            mxcad.drawEntity(polyline)

            mxcad.zoomAll()
            mxcad.zoomScale(0.8)
      }
    })
    return (<div style="height: 500px; overflow: hidden;"><canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
    </div>)
}
