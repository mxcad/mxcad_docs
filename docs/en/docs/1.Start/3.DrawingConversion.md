# Drawing conversion

Due to the large size of AutoCAD files (DWG, DXF) format files, many versions, complex format leads to direct loading in the web page efficiency is slow, occupy space memory and easy to load failure, therefore, we design and provide a unique web CAD file format: `.mxweb `, the file format is a good solution to many of the above problems. mxweb files and CAD drawing files can be converted to each other using the cloud map development kit we provide.

## Download the Cloud map development kit

We need to download [MxDraw cloud map development Kit](https://www.webcadsdk.com/)

Download good ` MxDrawCloudServer1.0 TryVersion. 7 z ` compressed package, unpack,

Go to the `MxDrawCloudServer\Bin\MxCAD\Release` location in the unzived directory, which is the program directory responsible for converting the `.mxweb` format

## Transfer CAD drawings to mxweb format

### Mode one

Open the command window where the directory of `MxDraw cloud image development Kit` is located after decompression, find the path of the target drawing, start the command line and run the command: mxcadassembly path of the target drawing.

Example code is as follows:

```bash

cd C:\Users\MxDev\Downloads\MxDrawCloudServer1.0TryVersion\MxDrawCloudServer\Bin\MxCAD\Release

mxcadassembly D:\test2.dwg

```
Wait for the command line output `{"code":0}` indicates that the drawing is successfully converted. Files successfully converted to `.mxweb` format are automatically saved in the same directory as the target drawing.

### Mode two

Open the command window where the directory of `MxDraw cloud image development Kit` is located after decompression, find the path where the target drawing is located, and start the command line to run the command: mxcadassembly JSON string

Example code is as follows:

```bash
mxcadassembly.exe {"srcpath":"D:\test2.dwg","outpath":"D:\","outname":"test", "compression":0}
```

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| srcpath | The path of the file to be converted |
| outpath | Indicates the path to the output file |
| outname | Indicates the file name of the output file (suffix must be added when converting mxweb to CAD drawings) |
| compression | 0 means that it is not compressed. Not writing this attribute means that it is compressed |

## mxweb format to CAD drawings

We can also convert the file paper in the format of '.mxweb 'into a file in the format of'.dwg 'through the program, and execute the following command:

```bash
mxcadassembly.exe {"srcpath":"D:\test.mxweb","outpath":"D:\","outname":"test.dwg"}
```
:::tip Look out
The outname parameter must be followed by the suffix of the CAD drawing, usually.dwg

## linux version

linux version The directory location of the program in the cloud map development package `MxDrawCloudServer/Bin/Linux/BinMxCAD`

```bash
ls
arm64  loongson  x86_64  x86_64_docker_alpine  x86_64_system_lib
```

In this directory, select an adaptation method for your system (the following uses the x86_64 architecture as an example) :   

```bash
cd x86_64
```

Perform the following operations under the method's folder

To access this directory we should first give permissions to these files and copy some directories to the specified location:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 mxcadassembly

sudo chmod -R 777 ./mx/so/*

sudo  cp -r -f ./mx/locale /usr/local/share/locale

â€‹./mxcadassembly "{'srcpath':'/home/mx/test.dwg','outpath':'/home/mx/Test','outname':'xxx'}"
```
Among them, srcpath: the path where the target CAD file is located, outpath: the path where the converted drawing file is specified to be located, outname: the specified file name of the output mxweb file.

Then refer to the windows version conversion file format for drawing conversion.
