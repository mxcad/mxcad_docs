> ## What is mxcad3d?

mxcad3d is a 3D CAD development framework developed using TypeScript and C++ based on [mxdraw](https://www.mxdraw3d.com/mxdraw_docs/start/abstract.html), THREE.js, and OpenCascade. It provides users with a rich set of development interfaces and offers an all-in-one solution for developing 3D CAD software. mxcad3d supports parametric creation of various 3D basic primitives and importing/displaying of multiple 3D model file formats such as STEP, IGES, STL, BREP, OBJ, OFF, PLY, and more.

> ## Key Features

- Efficient and convenient creation of basic primitives
- Rich JavaScript development interfaces for complex model creation
- Support for online customization and development

> ## Functionality Overview

- Basic Entities: Cube, Cylinder, Cone, Sphere, Torus, Wedge, Extrusion, Revolve, Loft, Pipe, and more.
- Geometric Operations:
  - Geometric Transformations: Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Mirroring.
  - Boolean Operations: Intersection, Difference, Union, Common Contours.
  - Fillet Operations: Fillets, Chamfers.
- Geometric Sketching: Lines, Circles, Ellipses, Hyperbolas, Parabolas, Rational B-Spline Curves, Bezier Curves, and more.
- Geometric Surfacing: Planes, Rational B-Spline Surfaces, Bezier Surfaces, and more.
- Annotations: Length, Radius, Diameter, Angle, Text Labels, and more.
- Others: Material, Color, Texture Mapping for model display, Undo/Redo, Sectioning.
