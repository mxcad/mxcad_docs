> ## Topological Shapes

Topological shapes consist of various primitive elements and complex shapes composed of these primitives.

|    Topological Shape Class    |          Description           |
| :---------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|      Mx3dShapeObject          | Represents a topological shape, base class for the following classes |
|      Mx3dShapeVertex          |       Represents a vertex       |
|       Mx3dShapeEdge           |     Represents an edge formed by connecting two vertices    |
|       Mx3dShapeWire           |   Consists of multiple connected edges and can be closed    |
|       Mx3dShapeFace           | Represents a face enclosed by a closed wire |
|       Mx3dShapeShell          | Consists of multiple faces and can be closed |
|       Mx3dShapeSolid          | Represents a solid enclosed by a closed shell |
|     Mx3dShapeCompSolid        | Represents a combination of multiple solids |
|      Mx3dShapeCompound        | Represents a combination of multiple shapes |

The above topological shape objects can be stored in document labels.
