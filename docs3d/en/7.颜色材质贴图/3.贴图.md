mxcad3d allows you to apply textures to models to enhance their visual representation. Before applying a texture, you need to prepare the images. You can use the API provided by mxcad3d to fetch image resources from a server URL.

> ## Texture Mapping

```typescript
// Use the LoadFileFromUrl method of Mx3dUtils to fetch the image resource from the URL
// The method returns the complete path of the image resource in the virtual local file system after it successfully loads.
const fname = await Mx3dUtils.LoadFileFromUrl(new URL("./assets/wood.jpg", import.meta.url).href, "wood.jpg");

const boxMaker = new Mx3dMkBox(50, 30, 20);
const boxShape = boxMaker.Shape();

const doc = mxcad3d.getDocument();
const boxLabel = doc.addShapeLabel();
boxLabel.setShape(boxShape);
boxLabel.setTexture(fname);
mxcad3d.update();
```

Using the static method `LoadFileFromUrl` of the [Mx3dUtils]() class, the script asynchronously fetches the `wood.jpg` image from the server's assets directory. The image is then saved to the virtual local file system's root directory with the name `wood.jpg` (specified as the second argument of `LoadFileFromUrl`). You can choose a different name for the image file, but the file extension must remain the same.

Once mxcad3d retrieves the image, the line `boxLabel.setTexture(fname)` fetches the `wood.jpg` image from the virtual local file system's root directory and assigns it as the texture for the model. After updating the display, the model will have the applied texture.
